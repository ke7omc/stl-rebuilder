# PROGRESS — lab notebook of the loop (agent-maintained)

## Current state
- Milestone: M0 — harness under construction. `harness/milestones.py` (all 5 specs),
  `harness/generators.py` (M1 only), `harness/metrics.py` (volume/CoM/inertia, symmetric
  surface deviation with by_z_bin, STEP round-trip), and `harness/meshcheck.py` (gmsh headless
  meshability check, run in a subprocess) are done and verified against M1 truth.
- Truth files written: `harness/truth/M1.step`, `harness/truth/M1.stl`.
- Unit tests: `tests/test_metrics.py` (6 tests) + `tests/test_meshcheck.py` (3 tests) — 9 total,
  all pass. meshcheck tests cover: M1 truth STEP meshes ok (min_quality > 0.1, no errors),
  missing file fails gracefully (ok=False + reason, no exception), subprocess timeout reported
  gracefully (monkeypatched).
- Still needed: `harness/score.py`, `harness/selftest.py`, and M2–M5 generators.

## Do not retry
- `BRepAlgoAPI_Cut.HasErrors()` does not exist in OCP 7.9.3. Use `IsDone()` only.

### iter 3 — M0 — sonnet/medium — 2026-08-29T08:23
- Score before: no score.py yet, so no formal harness score; PROGRESS.md pointed at
  meshcheck.py as the next step after metrics.py.
- Change: built `harness/meshcheck.py` per docs/research/02-...md §6 — `check_meshability(
  step_path, hmax, timeout_s=120.0) -> dict` spawns `python meshcheck.py <step> <hmax>` as a
  subprocess (gmsh crash/hang cannot kill the scorer), parses its JSON stdout. The in-subprocess
  `_run()` does the gmsh import/mesh/quality-check exactly per the research doc snippet: OCC
  importShapes, Mesh.MeshSizeMax/Min, generate(3), getElementQualities minSICN, checks BOTH the
  exception path and the 0-tet/logger-Error path (gmsh can complete generate(3) after only
  surface meshing without raising). Subprocess crash, timeout, or unparseable stdout all return
  `{"ok": False, "reason": ...}` instead of raising. Added `tests/test_meshcheck.py`.
- Score after (local): no score.py so no formal harness score; manually verified —
  `check_meshability("harness/truth/M1.step", hmax=100)` → ok=True, n_tet=133384,
  min_quality=0.234 (> gate 0.1), 0 errors. Missing-file path returns ok=False with the gmsh
  error text, no exception raised. `pytest tests/` → 9 passed (6 metrics + 3 meshcheck).
- Learned: gmsh 4.15.2 (pip wheel) ships OCCT compiled in — STEP import works with zero extra
  installs. `gmsh.model.occ.importShapes` raises a plain `Exception` (not a gmsh-specific type)
  on a bad path, with the real reason in `gmsh.logger.getLastError()`'s text embedded in the
  message. Subprocess approach means `gmsh.finalize()` not reached on that raised-exception path
  in the child, but that's fine — the child process exits and is fully torn down either way.
- Next: `harness/score.py` — wire milestones+generators+metrics+meshcheck into the fail-fast
  CLI contract from MISSION.md §7 (run rebuild.py as subprocess in a temp cwd on a neutrally
  named STL copy, cheap→expensive checks, progress formula, hints, exit 0/1/2, out/score.json).
  Then `harness/selftest.py`.

### iter 2 — M0 — sonnet/medium — 2026-08-29T08:15
- Score before: no score.json yet; PROGRESS.md pointed at metrics.py as the next step.
- Change: built `harness/metrics.py` — `load_mesh`, `volume_com_inertia` (gates on `.is_volume`,
  returns volume_err_pct/com_err_frac/inertia_err_frac), `surface_deviation` (100k-sample +
  vertices, both directions, max/p99/rms/argmax, optional `by_z_bin` region table per MISSION §7
  contract), `read_step`/`step_roundtrip_check` (STEPControl_Reader + BRepGProp, never raises,
  reports a failed check dict on read errors). Added `tests/test_metrics.py`.
- Score after (local): no score.py yet so no formal harness score; manually verified against
  `harness/truth/M1.*`: self-deviation max=7e-8mm, STEP volume vs closed-form rel err <1e-15,
  1%-scaled mesh correctly flagged (deviation ~100mm, volume_err_pct ~3%). `pytest
  tests/test_metrics.py -q` → 6 passed.
- Learned: `STEPControl_Reader.ReadFile` returns `IFSelect_ReturnStatus.IFSelect_RetDone` (enum,
  compare directly, no `.value` needed) in OCP 7.9.3; `TransferRoots()` returns the count
  transferred. `trimesh.proximity.ProximityQuery(mesh).on_surface(pts)` returns
  `(closest_points, distance, triangle_id)` as documented — confirmed live.
- Next: `harness/meshcheck.py` (gmsh subprocess check per docs/research/02 §6), then
  `harness/score.py` wiring milestones+generators+metrics+meshcheck into the fail-fast CLI
  contract, then `harness/selftest.py`.

### iter 1 — M0 — sonnet/medium — 2026-08-29T08:09
- Score before: no score.json (first iteration)
- Change: built `harness/milestones.py` (all 5 specs with params/regions/gates/args/runtime caps)
  and `harness/generators.py` (M1 annular cylinder only; M2-M5 raise NotImplementedError).
  Fixed: `BRepAlgoAPI_Cut.HasErrors()` absent in OCP 7.9.3 — removed that check.
- Score after (local): M1 BRepGProp volume = 2.858849e+10 mm³, closed-form same → 0 % error.
  STEP and STL written successfully.
- Learned: OCP 7.9.3 BRepAlgoAPI_Cut exposes only IsDone(); no HasErrors(). BRepGProp
  returns exact volume for boolean-cut cylinders (no floating-point error at all).
- Next: build `harness/metrics.py` (volume/CoM/inertia from trimesh; symmetric deviation;
  STEP round-trip) and `harness/meshcheck.py` (gmsh subprocess check).
